### Even since I was a kid I wanted to work and make my own money, because I was born in a modest family in Romania with "enough" shortages.
### Doing a couple of "jobs", I realized that doing something just for money is not that jolly. I tried to figure out something that I love to do and, of course, to find a job that is about that thing.
## Surprising, it was hard!
### When I almost quit, going through:sports, driving, cooking, video editing I found out about coding.
### I heard something before about it, but in my mind was that I need years and years of learning to become successful. Being at the end of my high school I did not consider coding a career, because I came in London and I had to support myself.
### After almost 6 years of watching youtube tutorials and following free online courses I realized that this is that "something" I was searching for, at my 18's.
### Spending hours of my free time learning, without any interest, proved me that this has to be my career.
### And, here am I, happy and proud of what I am doing.
