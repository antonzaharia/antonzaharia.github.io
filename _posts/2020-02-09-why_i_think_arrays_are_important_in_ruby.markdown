When I started to write my first lines of code I firstly used variables. From that point of view there was noother needs to store data. "As long as I can store a piece of that, I'm fine." I was not thinking that I will need to work with, maybe, thousands of pieces of data.
I see variables as words, and arrays as enumerations. Trying to associate coding with real world makes me understand arrays.
Arrays will be useless without iteration. Having tons of data stored and couldn't check ".each" one of them, would be just raw text.
My opinion is that the most important thing to know about arrays are their methods. If you know to write an array is good but to know how to use them for your needs is great.
That being said I see storing data is important, but using the stored that is essential.
