On my final project assessment, my professor suggested me to have a look over WebSockets and try to use them in a project.
After I checked his suggestions, I decided to start building a chat app.
I will use React to handle my frontend and Rails to handle any backend.

It won't be a simple app, only to use WebSockets. I will implement a registration form that will utilize JSON Web Tokens and try to make it as secure as possible. 

While I was creating my portfolio, I faced an issue with my components transitions, and I figure it out by using react-spring that showed up by being a useful tool and not even that hard to use.

For the design of the app, I will use the Atomize design system for two reasons:
-on almost all my projects, I used Bootstrap, and I want to change that.
-it is perfect to use for this app from my point of view.

Check the status of the app on GitHub:

I will come back with other posts about issues and the right matches.
