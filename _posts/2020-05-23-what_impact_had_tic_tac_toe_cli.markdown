The Tic Tac Toe Lab camed on Object Oriented Ruby, which was a new idea of understanding how web apps work.
Facing this idea firstly it sacred me, but after I went through the stepts and understood the logic behind it, I wrote all the needed metods and it starts making sense.

To be honest, I didn't had a full understanding of a CLI app. I completely got that after the first project.

Tic Tac Toe game made me undestand how complex a Ruby program can be and that a ruby developer is exactly like a painting.

What I mean by that is that sky its the limit, actually.

You can write an app that simply `puts` "Hello!" in the console.

```
# /hello.rb

def say_hello
  puts "Hello!"
end
```

Or you can write complex apps that can find combinations of three numbers which matches the winning numbers from the tic tac toe game.

It is your choice how you use the ruby code and it's your responsibility too.
